I made this project just as a prctice for my designing and development skills. I usually design by keeping a minimal and monomchromatic look in mind, but as this project was for a tech event, I worked outside my comfort zone and gave it a corporate look.

Made purely in HTML and CSS. JS is used only on register page. The site is not yet responsive for other devices such as tablets and mobile phones and may give a broken look. I might make the site responsive if I have some spare time in between the next project.

The prompt for this project was generated by ChatGPT. To increase the realism to the prompt I broke it down in small parts such as main prompt, date and venue, speakers, sponsors. Entire prompt was as follows:

Hi there,

I'm looking for a web developer to create a website for an upcoming event that I'm organizing. The event is a two-day conference that will be held in May, and we're expecting around 500 attendees from around the world.

We need a website that will serve as a central hub for all the event-related information, including the schedule, speakers, sponsors, and registration. We also want to make sure that the website has a modern and professional design that reflects the theme of the event and is easy to navigate.

Ideally, the website should allow attendees to register online. We also want to be able to track attendance and send out email updates and reminders to attendees.

If this sounds like something you can help us with, please let me know your availability and pricing, and any previous experience you have with event websites. We're looking to get started as soon as possible, so please let me know if you're interested and available.

Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
